This file is simply to ensure that this directory is created within the file system. The module/plugin optimizes SXA site's SXALayout.cshtml, increasing a site's performance score by doing the following:

1. Bundles all javascript files that would render at the bottom of the DOM into one javascript file. The new javascript file gets added into this directory.
2. Asynchronously renders the newly bundled file at the top of the DOM.
3. Preloads all css files.
