# Contributing to SXA Theme Optimizations
Input is always appreciated! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Proposing new features
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Report bugs and submit feature requests using Github's [issues](https://github.com/rbaconsulting/sxa-theme-optimizations/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and feature requests. Report a bug or request a feature by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/rbaconsulting/sxa-theme-optimizations/issues). There will be an issue template avaliable for both.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). If you create a pull request, feel free to create a new issue for it beforehand or afterwards:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
5. Make sure your code compiles.
3. Update documentation as needed and match the existing documentation.
7. Create a new pull request from your forked repo.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
